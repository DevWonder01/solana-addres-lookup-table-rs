Solana Address Lookup Table (ALT) Creator

This Rust utility provides a simple, standalone function to create and extend a Solana Address Lookup Table (ALT) on the Mainnet/Devnet. It's designed to be used in projects that require a consistent lookup table to reduce transaction size and avoid the "transaction too large" error.

How to Use
The core of this project is the create_atl_address function, which handles the entire process of creating an ALT from scratch and extending it with a predefined set of addresses.

Prerequisites
You must have the following installed to run this code:

Rust and Cargo

A funded Solana Mainnet/Devnet wallet.

Environment Variables
Before running, you need to set two environment variables:

DEV_B58: The Base58-encoded private key of your Solana wallet. This wallet will be the payer and authority for the lookup table.

RPC_URL: The RPC endpoint URL you want to use. The Devnet endpoint is recommended for this example.

Example for a Unix-like shell:

export DEV_B58="<YOUR_BASE58_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE>"
export RPC_URL="[https://api.devnet.solana.com](https://api.devnet.solana.com)"

Running the Code
Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.

Ensure your Cargo.toml dependencies are compatible. The solana-sdk and related crates must be on the same version. A good starting point is 2.0.0 for all of them.

Run the utility:

cargo run

The output will be the public key of the newly created lookup table. You can then use this address in your main application's code to build versioned transactions.


ðŸ§  Functionality Overview
The create_atl_address function performs the following three steps:

Creation: Sends a transaction with a create_lookup_table instruction. This initializes a new, empty lookup table on the network.

Extension: After confirming the table's creation, it sends a second transaction with an extend_lookup_table instruction. This instruction populates the table with a list of the most common program IDs, as well as any other addresses your application will use repeatedly.

Verification: It fetches and deserializes the newly created lookup table to confirm that all addresses were added successfully. The function then returns the lookup table's public key.
